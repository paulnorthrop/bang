## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* In DESCRIPTION: removed the capitalization in "Analysis of Variance".

* In DESCRIPTION: removed the sentence that refered to a bang website.

I have left the title unchanged. I do appreciate your point about the title
(and agree that yours is probably better) but I'd like to stick with the
same title, if that's OK.
