Description: Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of some simple 
    commonly-used models, without using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
    methods such as Gibbs sampling.  The 'rust' package  
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is used 
    to simulate a random sample from the required posterior distribution.  
    At the moment three conjugate hierarchical models are available:
    beta-binomial, gamma-Poisson and a 1-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
    See the 'bang' website for more information, documentation and examples.
